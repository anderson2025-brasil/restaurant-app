Why This App?
As someone working in the food service industry, I understand the challenges of finding reliable staff on short notice or suitable work as an employee. This app addresses these common problems:

Sudden staffing shortages due to illness, vacations, or resignations.

The Restaurant Staff App is a practical solution for these everyday challenges.
